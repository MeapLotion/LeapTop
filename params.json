  "body": "Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality technologies are becoming more popular every day. They bring with them the interesting challenge of interaction in a 3D environment. Mouse and keyboard are not enough, and that's where the Leap Motion comes in. The Leap Motion is a sensor device that tracks the position of hands in 3D space. Using this, we decided to tackle 3D user interfaces using a file manager. We decided to make a desktop application primarily because VR/AR technologies are still far from widespread distribution. This application can be a stepping stone for the common user, getting them used to gesture-based input to ease the transition to VR/AR.",
